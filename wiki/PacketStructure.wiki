They packet for now is 8Byte header + 4096 bytes of data. Making the whole packet 4014 bytes.  Data size may need to be adjusted for speed.

First 8 bytes are the header in ASCII which define what type of packet it is. 
   *CONTFILE*
If the first 8 bytes are CONTFILE then it means "Continue File Transfer." If this is then:
      First Byte=FileID
      Rest of bytes=raw file data
